to retrieve the data from excel files (CRUD)
one way - we can consider excel workbook as db (every sheet as a table) - sql queries pyodbc
2nd way - openpyxl


pyodbc
connect to db - connection obj  (using connection strings)
connection obj - we can create a cursor (helps us to execute sql queries)
cursor obj - execute the sql queries


SELECT * from [Data$] where S_No='TC_5'
SELECT * from Data where S_No='TC_5'


update Data set Username='new_suresh' where S_No='TC_2'
update [Data$] set Username='new_suresh' where S_No='TC_2'


delete from Data where Username='Virat'
delete from [Data$] where Username='Virat'


insert into Data values('TC_8','random','369','yes')
insert into [Data$] values('TC_8','random','369','yes')
